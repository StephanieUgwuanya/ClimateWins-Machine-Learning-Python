<h1>ClimateWins-Machine-Learning-Python</h1>

Cimate Wins is interested in using machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change around Europe and, potentially, the world.
Their primary concern lies in the growing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events observed over the past two decades.

<h1>Key Questions & Objectives</h1>
ClimateWins aims to harness machine learning tools to develop a model capable of predicting weather patterns, including extreme events, across mainland Europe. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, this model has the potential to provide accurate weather forecasts globally, helping communities prepare for and mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions.

<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
Hypothesis 1: Can Machine Learning Improve Prediction Accuracy for Extreme Weather Events?

Hypothesis 2: Which machine learning models are most effective for forecasting extreme weather events?

Hypothesis 3: Can Machine Learning Improve Climate Risk Assessment for Agriculture and Other Sectors?
